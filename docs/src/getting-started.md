The `parse-it` library is currently in the early stages of development and still lacks many features. Comprehensive documentation will be provided once the library stabilizes.

In the meantime, you can refer to the examples in the [examples](https://github.com/Wybxc/parse-it/tree/master/parse-it/examples) directory.
